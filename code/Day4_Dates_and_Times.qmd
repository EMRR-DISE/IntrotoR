## Dates and Times

Dates and times are one of the more challenging data classes to deal with. There are many different ways of storing date and time information, and it's easy to get them mixed up. Fortunately, there are a number of tricks that help make things easier, most of which are in the package [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/index.html), which is part of the tidyverse.

For more info, see the Dates and Times chapter in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/datetimes.html).

First, let's look at dates. Dates are stored as the number of days since the origin (default origin is 1970-01-01). We can use the `today` function to get a date with today's value.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

today()

as.numeric(today())
```

Now let's talk about date-times. R automatically stores the dates and times together as the number of seconds since the origin.

```{r}
now()

as.numeric(now())
```

Note that R automatically set the time in Pacific Daylight time since that is what the operating system of this computer uses.

## Date/Time Classes

If you have a list of dates and times that you are importing into R, the `read_csv` or `read_excel` functions can usually guess when they are dates, particularly if they are in YYYY-MM-DD format, but sometimes they get confused. They have an especially hard time if they are in a non-standard format, such as MM/DD/YY. In this case, the field will get read in as a character and you have to convert it to a date/time class, usually POSIXct.

Before we do that, let's learn a bit about different types of date/time classes.

Date - Number of days since origin.

POSIXct - Number of seconds since origin. This is the most common format.

POSIXlt - List of vectors with components `sec`, `min`, `hour`, `mday`, `mon`, and `year`. You probably won't use this format very often.

`POSIXct` is more convenient for including in data frames, and `POSIXlt` is closer to human-readable forms. Both classes may have an attribute `tzone`, specifying the time zone. See `?DateTimeClasses` for details.

Note: There is no built-in "Time" class, only "DateTime". Some packages (like `hms`) have developed ways to deal with times on their own, but it doesn't come with your base R installation.

## Converting from character dates

The built-in function to convert from characters to dates is `strptime`

```{r}
#| eval: false
?strptime
```

To use this function, we just feed in the date in character form and specify what format it is in. The format syntax is a little annoying, but the documentation for `strptime` gives you all the options.

```{r}
# Date in character format
date1 <- "2/3/2021"

# Convert it. Little m for month, little d for day, capital Y for four-digit year.
date1_conv <- strptime(date1, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
date1_conv
```

```{r}
# Try a different format. Lowercase y for two-digit year.
date2 <- "2/3/21"
date2_conv <- strptime(date2, format = "%m/%d/%y")
date2_conv
```

```{r}
# Now one with time included. Note that any spaces or dashes need to be the same in the format call as in your character vector.
date3 <- "2-3-2021 08:15"
date3_conv <- strptime(date3, format = "%m-%d-%Y %H:%M")
date3_conv
```

The format strings are quite annoying, so fortunately the lubridate package has a number of shortcut functions to make converting easier.

```{r}
#| eval: false
?ymd
```

Let's try the dates we converted above with these functions.

```{r}
mdy(date1)

mdy(date2)

mdy_hm(date3)
```

Note that `strptime` defaulted the time zone to PDT, whereas `mdy_hm` defaulted to UTC. It's always wise to specify your time zone manually to make sure issues don't come up.

```{r}
mdy_hm(date3, tz = "America/Los_Angeles")
```

Note that when I specified the time zone, I actually specified the location, since we switch time zones with Daylight Savings.

To get a complete list of time zone names, see `OlsonNames()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
OlsonNames()
```

If you have a dataset that is collected in California, but doesn't use Daylight savings, use "Etc/GMT+8". GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) doesn't change with daylight savings, and we are 8 hours behind. Most if not all water quality data collected by DWR is recorded in Pacific Standard Time (PST) year-round, so "Etc/GMT+8" is the correct time zone to use for these instances.

```{r}
mdy_hm(date3, tz = "Etc/GMT+8")
```

The lubridate package also has a few other useful functions for working with time zones - `tz`, `force_tz`, and `with_tz`. 

You can check the time zone of a date-time object with the `tz` function.

```{r}
date4 <- ymd_hms("2025-06-19 14:00:00")
tz(date4)
```

If you have a date-time object that is in the wrong time zone, you can use `force_tz` to change the time zone but keep the same clock time. For example,

```{r}
date4
date4_conv <- force_tz(date4, tzone = "Etc/GMT+8")
date4_conv 
```

If you want to convert a date-time object to an new time zone, converting both the clock time and time zone, you can use the 'with_tz' function.

```{r}
date4_conv
with_tz(date4_conv, tzone = "America/Los_Angeles")
```

R automatically displays dates and times in Year-Month-Day format. This is the international standard. If you want to change the output format, just use the `format` function. Note that this converts the date back to a character class.

```{r}
date1_conv
format(date1_conv, format = "%m/%d/%y")
```

But really, why would you want to change the format?

## Times

As noted above, there is no built-in `time` class. Only date/time classes. So, if we have a bunch of times R will automatically add a date to them.

```{r}
times <- c("1:20", "2:30", "3:50", "14:00")
times <- strptime(times, format = "%H:%M")
times
```

It will usually default to today's date, or sometimes to Dec 31st, 1899. If you have a "Date" and a "Time" column in your dataframe, it's best to just combine them for manipulation.

```{r}
df_date_times <- tibble(
  times = c("1:20", "2:30", "3:50", "14:00"),
  dates = c("2021-01-01", "2023-12-01", "2011-06-04", "2022-10-11")
)

glimpse(df_date_times)

df_date_times_c <- df_date_times %>% 
  mutate(
    Date = ymd(dates), 
    Time = strptime(times, format = "%H:%M"),
    DateTime = ymd_hm(paste(dates, times), tz = "America/Los_Angeles")
  )

glimpse(df_date_times_c)
tz(df_date_times_c$DateTime)
```

If you do really want to deal with just the time part of a date-time object, use the `hms` package.

```{r}
library(hms)

times
as_hms(times)
```

## Extracting parts of a date-time object

the lubridate package has a lot of really useful functions to extract components from dates and times such as month, year, day, etc.

```{r}
date1_conv

# Year
year(date1_conv)

# Month (as number or name)
month(date1_conv)
month(date1_conv, label = TRUE)

# Day
day(date1_conv)

# Day of year
yday(date1_conv)

# Day of week
wday(date1_conv, label = TRUE)
```
