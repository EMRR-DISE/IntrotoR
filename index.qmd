# Intro to R for DWR

Welcome to the Intro to R class for the Department of Water Resources, 2024!

For the first time, this is not taught by outside consultants, but by your own colleagues here at the department.

## Ground rules

-   Please participate fully in the class. You will get out of this class exactly as much as you put into it. This means not multi-tasking, completing the exercises, and asking questions when you get stuck.

-   Please come prepared. Install software ahead of time, have the link to this book on-hand, and review materials from the previous day before the next day's class.

-   Don't be afraid to ask questions! Any coding language can be frustrating, so please speak up if you are having trouble. One of our teaching assistants can work with you 1:1 for major problems.

## Before you come to class

-   Install R

    -   Go to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN) webpage and download R for Windows.

    -   Open the installer and follow the prompts to install R on your computer using the default settings. You may need an administrator account to complete this step.

    -   If you already have R on your computer, please make sure it is version 4.0 or above. (The latest version is 4.4.1)

    -   See full instructions here: <https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html>

-   Install R Studio

    -   Go to the [Download Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) page on the Posit website and download R Studio for Windows.

    -   Open the installer and follow the prompts to install R on your computer using the default settings. You may need an administrator account to complete this step.

-   Open RStudio and make sure it runs.

    -   The window titled "Console" should come up and have the R version and some boilerplate information about R in it, with a blue carrot and cursor below it.

-   Install the `tidyverse` and `here` packages

    -   In your console, type `install.packages("tidyverse", "here")`
    -   The package should download and install automatically. You do not need administrative privileges for this step.
    -   NOTE: There are sometimes issues accessing CRAN from within RStudio while connected to a DWR network. If you receive this message, use your home wifi or a cell phone hot spot to connect to the internet, then try again.
